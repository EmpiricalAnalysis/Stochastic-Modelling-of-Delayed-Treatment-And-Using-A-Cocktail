# Stochastic Modelling of Delayed Treatment & Using A Cocktail to Address Acquired Drug Resistance

In this course project I again designed and implemented a stochastic simulation of patient and virus population dynamics. This time I explored the effects of delaying treatment on patient disease and simulated the effects of using a cocktail to address drug resistance. 

The python codes I wrote are in ps4.py .
