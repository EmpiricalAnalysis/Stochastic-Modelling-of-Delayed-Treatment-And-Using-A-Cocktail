# Stochastic Modelling of Delayed Treatment & Using A Cocktail to Address Acquired Drug Resistance

This is a project I completed while taking "MITx: 6.00.2x Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science" on Edx. The purpose of this project is to allow students to design and implement a stochastic simulation of patient and virus population dynamics that explores the effect of delaying treatment on patient disease and to simulate the effects of using a cocktail to address acquired drug resistance. 

The python codes I wrote are in ps4.py .
